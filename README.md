# RxJS is used in Angular for:

### Event handling
RxJS can be used to handle events, such as user input or WebSocket messages, as streams of data.

### State management
RxJS can be used to manage the state of an application, by creating Observables that emit the current state and using operators to update the state in response to events.

### Handling HTTP requests
The HttpClient service in Angular returns Observables, which are used to handle the responses from HTTP requests.

### Managing data streams
RxJS provides operators for transforming, filtering, and combining data streams, which is useful for handling real-time data updates and user interactions.

### Boosting Performance
Angular updates when needed, rather than constantly polling and checking the state of variables. 

### CLI
```
ng g c /pages/page-name
ng g c /components/component-name
ng g s /services/service-name
```
